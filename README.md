# üåü Clarity - Simplify Your Eye Care Routine

## üéâ About Clarity
Clarity is a minimalistic reminder app designed to support the 20-20-20 rule. This simple principle encourages you to look away from your screen every 20 minutes and focus on something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds. The app is built with Go and uses OpenGL for smooth graphics. It's a perfect tool for anyone who spends long hours on their computer and wants to prioritize their eye health.
